*** raw_data.pdf: the raw data is plotted. Time Series with more than 165 frames are considered (shorter than 4.5 hours). 
Time Series has erased the last 15 points. 

*** .xlsx, sheet "ID_Data": ['Cell_Number', 'First_spot_ID', 'Track_ID', 'Starting_frame', 'Ending_frame', 'Condition']
are indicated for each traze of the dataset.

*** quality_trackinbg_test.pdf: The raw data and the tracking variance are plotted. 




# =============================================================================
# #Min Polynomial Detrend
# =============================================================================

First, we find the local minima considering a time window of 5 frames on each time serie.
Then, we make a polynomial fit over the given minima & the first and last point of the Time Serie.
It's degree is (2 + #of minima)/delta. We have seen many examples and we choose delta = 3. 


*** .xlsx, sheet "_MinPolDT_Data": Filter specifications are write down: 
the order of the polinomia, the number of minima and the polonomia coefficients for each time serie of teh dataset.

*** filtermin_pol_order.png: the order of the polynomial fit is plotted for each traze.

*** min_detrend.pdf: The detrend and the raw data are plotted.

*** min_detrended_TS.pdf: The detrended time series are plotted.


# =============================================================================
# #Butter_Filter detrend
# =============================================================================

This filter is defined in terms of frequency. Is designed to be  a *square filter*: is maximally flat 
 in the passband and rolls off towards zero in the stopband, in terms of frequency. 
 Then, the way we apply this filter to the data is by using another method, called
  *zero phase filtering*. This is a zero phase filter has the advantage of providing no 
  phase distortion (time phase or linear phase) cause we apply the filter *forward and backward* 
  in time.
In the calculation I've performed, this w frequency is normalized by the nyquist frequency ,
 for ex, a w_cutoff = 0.6  means a w_real_cutoff_value = 0.6*W_nyquist).  In our case, is n = 4.
We are performing a Band Pass Filter, with w<0.025 & w>0.6 are gone. This means that we are
considering periods T that 1.46 minutes <T< 35 minutes. 


*** BPfilt_detrend.pdf: The detrend and the raw data are plotted.

*** amp_Histograms.pdf: amplitude histograms for the raw & detrended data.
x=0 is indicated with a dotted line. The integral over the range values is 1 (normed).
DT_MEAN_INTENSITY: detrended data using the min pol detrend strategy.
MEAN_INTENSITY_BP: detrended data using the Butter filter strategy

*** cum_amp_Histograms.pdf: amplitude cumulative histograms for the raw & detrended data.
x=0 is indicated with a dotted line.


*** statistics.pdf: Boxplot of some statistical measures: Mean of the amplitude, Variance of the amplitude, 
length of the Time Series & Median of the amplitude  for each concentration strategy and condition. 
Finally, the percentiles [0,3,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55,60,65,70,75,80,85,90,95,97,100] are 
plotted  for each concentration strategy and condition. The scale is conserved between rows. 


# =============================================================================
# #Find_Peaks
# =============================================================================

Look for local maxima higher than a threshold 
[Parameters = threshold, order of the finding peaks – definition of the local neighbors].

The order of the algorithm tell us wich time resolution do we have. 
For example, if we have an “order 2”, it means we have a time window of 3 frames between 
each peak we can identify. That means 3 frames *105/60 = 5.25 minutes.  
The acquisition frequency is 1.75 minutes x frame.

Once we have detrended the data, if we perform the analysis setting order=2, we do not
identify many spoureus peaks, and we win some time between peaks resolution. That is the
main reason why I perfomrmed the analysis setting order = 2.

*** threshold_analysis_(#).pdf: Each column corresponds to a different detrending strategy.
Remember that we can't compare amplitudes between each detrending strategy, so we
can't compare Threshold values as well. 

(FIRST ROW) Density of peaks as a function of the Threshold for order 2, for 0ng (negative control) and 
WT_ESL (positive control) conditions. 

The Density of peaks is calculated as follows for each Threshold and each condition:
    1 - for each traze/cell, we calculate the #_of_peaks/total_frames.
    2 - we add all the results, having a "density of peaks" for each Threshold and condition
Finally, we divide each result for the maximum value obtained (we normalize).

The cross indicates the threshold we need to set if we assume that (#) percent of the 0ng
are peaks. 

(SECOND ROW) The 0ng/WT ratio  & WT-0ng difference of peaks densities as a function of the Threshold. 
The densities are the same as the FIRST ROW plot. 

The point where the ratio is lower than the 5% is indicated. 
The point where the difference is maximal is indicated.
