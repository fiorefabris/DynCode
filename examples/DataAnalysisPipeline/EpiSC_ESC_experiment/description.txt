0- Download the data. We consider time series with more than 150 frames. 

1- we deleted the last 20 frames (about 7 min) of the time series of dividing cells only. In this case, only 1 WT condition.

2- smoothing. We filtered the highest frequencies in the data using a moving average window of 3 frames of duration. 

3- max and minima. searched the time series for all the local maxima and minima. We compared each value xi of the time series with its immediate neighbours
