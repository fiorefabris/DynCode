## Local Analysis module

Computes the local information theory quantifiers Shanon Entropy and normalized Shannon Entropy, Bandtâ€“Pompe probability distribution (in the frequency of ordinal patterns sense), Permutation Entropy, Weighted Permutation Entropy, Fisher information, Jensen-Shannon divergence, Complexity and Disequilibrium following the definitions in [*Permutation Entropy and Its Main Biomedical and Econophysics Applications: A Review*](https://doi.org/10.3390/e14081553) and [*Statistical Complexity and Fisher-Shannon Information: Applications*](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-90-481-3890-6_4).


Computes the local statistical quantifiers as Fano factor, local variance, local mean, local CV.
